PushCamera(Camera)
</signature>
Store all camera settings.
The camera settings will be added to a so-called "stack" list, where they will stay until retrieved by a call to ::ref::PopCamera. The settings will be stored in the reverse of the order in which they were added, so a call to PopCamera will retrieve the most recently stored Camera data and then remove it from the stack. A subsequent call to PopCamera will then retrieve the next most recently pushed data and so on.
