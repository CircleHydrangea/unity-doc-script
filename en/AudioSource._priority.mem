Sets the priority of the [[AudioSource]].
Unity is virtualizing AudioSources, when there's more AudioSources playing than available hardware channels.
The AudioSources with lowest priority (and audibility) is virtualized first.
Priority is an integer between 0 and 255. 0=highest priority, 255=lowest priority.
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX
	// occlude this sound if we dont have hardware resources to virtualize it

	audio.priority = 255;
END EX
