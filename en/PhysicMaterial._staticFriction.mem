staticFriction
</signature>
The friction coefficient used when an object is lying on a surface.
Must be >= 0.  Natural materials will usually have a friction coefficient between 0 (no friction at all, like slippy ice) and 1 (full friction, like rubber). Values larger then 1 are possible, and may be realistic for sticky materials.
