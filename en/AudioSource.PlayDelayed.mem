PlayDelayed(float)
</signature>
Plays the ::ref::clip with a delay specified in seconds. Users are advised to use this function instead of the old Play(delay) function that took a delay specified in samples relative to a reference rate of 44.1 kHz as an argument.
__Note:__ This function replaces the Play(delay) function when called with the delay-argument. In that function the delay had to be specified as samples relative to a reference rate of 44100. This is inconvenient when the engine is running on a different sample rate and the source sound has an even different rate. Working with delays specified in seconds makes this independent of these.
@param delay Delay time specified in seconds.
