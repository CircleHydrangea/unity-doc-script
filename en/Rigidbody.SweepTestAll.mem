Like [[Rigidbody.SweepTest]], but returns all hits.
The sweep may return multiple hits against the same collider if more then one of the rigidbody's attached colliders would hit it.

Note that this function only works when a primitive collider type (sphere, cube or capsule) is attached to the rigidbody object - mesh colliders will not work, although they can be detected in the scene by the sweep.
@param direction Direction to sweep the Rigidbody object.
@param distance Length of the sweep.
