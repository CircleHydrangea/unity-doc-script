Reverb Zones are used when you want to create location based ambient effects in the scene.
As the Audio Listener moves into a Reverb Zone, the ambient effect associated with the zone is gradually applied.
At the max distance there is no effect and at the min distance the effect is fully applied.
For example you can gradually change your character's footsteps sounds and create the
feeling like you where entering into a cavern, going trough a room,
swimming underwater, etc.

You can always mix reverb zones to have combined effects.
