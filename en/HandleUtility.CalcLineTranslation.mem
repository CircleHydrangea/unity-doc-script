CalcLineTranslation(Vector2,Vector2,Vector3,Vector3)
</signature>
Map a mouse drag onto a movement along a line in 3D space.
Certain types of Handles (such as arrows) involve movement along a line in 3D space. For example, the Transform's position arrows move the object along its local X, Y or Z axis as the mouse is dragged. The CalcLineTranslation function converts the movement of the mouse into constrained movement along a 3D line in the familiar way used by Unity's built-in tools.
@param src The source point of the drag.
@param dest The destination point of the drag.
@param srcPosition The 3D position the dragged object had at /src/ ray.
@param constraintDir 3D direction of constrained movement.
@return The distance travelled along constraintDir.
