recorderStartTime
</signature>
Start time of the first frame of the buffer relative to the frame at which ::ref::StartRecording was called.
For example, if we started recording at frame 10, and the buffer is 5 frames long.
If the buffer is not initialized (::ref::StartRecording is not called), the value of this property will be -1.

SA: ::ref::recorderStopTime.
