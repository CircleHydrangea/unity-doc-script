Rigidbodyオブジェクトに許可されているソルバー反復回数
The solverIterationCount determines how accuratly joints and contacts are resolved. 
If you are having trouble with jointed bodies oscillating and behaving erratically setting 
a higher solver iteration count may improve their stability.
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX
	rigidbody.solverIterationCount = 10;
END EX
