recorderStopTime
</signature>
End time of the recorded clip relative to when ::ref::StartRecording was called.
For example, if we started recording at second 10, and ended recording at second 15, then this will have a value of 5.
If the buffer is not initialized (::ref::StartRecording is not called), the value of this property will be -1.
SA: ::ref::recorderStartTime.
