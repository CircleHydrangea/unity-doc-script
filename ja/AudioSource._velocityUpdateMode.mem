fixedまたはdynamicで更新する必要があるかを返す（デフォルトはfixed）。
Make sure this is set to update in the same update loop as the Audio Source is moved in if you are experiencing problems with Doppler effect simulation for this source.
The default setting will automatically set the source to be updated in the fixed update loop if it is attached to a rigidbody, and dynamic otherwise.
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX
	audio.velocityUpdateMode = AudioVelocityUpdateMode.Fixed;
END EX
