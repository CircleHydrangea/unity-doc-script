It is precomputed on import for imported models based on animations associated with that model, which means that
the bounding box might be much bigger than the mesh itself. It is recomputed every time when
::ref::updateWhenOffscreen is enabled, but in this case it would be exactly the size of the mesh at that frame.
SA: ::ref::updateWhenOffscreen.
