XYZ軸それぞれの物理演算による、位置や回転の影響を受けるか／受けないか。
By default this is RigidbodyConstraints.FreezeNone, allowing rotation and movement along all axes.
In some cases, you may want to constrain a Rigidbody to only move or rotate along some axes, for 
example when developing 2D games. You can use the bitwise OR operator to combine multiple
constraints.
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX
	// Freeze the rotation around x-Axis
	rigidbody.constraints = RigidbodyConstraints.FreezeRotationX | RigidbodyConstraints.FreezeRotationY;
END EX
