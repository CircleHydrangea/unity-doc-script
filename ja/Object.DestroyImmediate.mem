DestroyImmediate(Object,bool)
</signature>
すぐにオブジェクトを破壊する。だが、Destroy関数の方を使うことを推奨
This function should only be used when writing editor code since the delayed destruction
will never be invoked in edit mode.
In game code it is recommended to use Object.Destroy instead. Destroy is always delayed (but
executed within the same frame)
Use this function with care since it can destroy assets permanently!
