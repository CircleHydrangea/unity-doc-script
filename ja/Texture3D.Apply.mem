Apply()
Apply(bool)
</signature>
Actually apply all previous ::ref::SetPixels changes.
If /updateMipmaps/ is /true/, the mipmap levels are recalculated as well, using
the base level as a source. Usually you want to use /true/ in all cases except when
you've modified the mip levels yourself using ::ref::SetPixels.

This is a potentially expensive operation, so you'll want to change as many pixels
as possible between /Apply/ calls.

SA: ::ref::SetPixels functions.
