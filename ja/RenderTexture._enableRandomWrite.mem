Enable DX11 random access write into this render texture.
[[wiki:DirectX 11]] pixel or compute shaders can write into arbitrary locations of some textures, called "unordered access views" in DX11. Set this flag before creating your render texture to enable this capability.

When a texture has this flag set, it can be written into as one RWTexture* resources in shaders. It can also be set as random access write target for pixel shaders using Graphics.SetRandomWriteTarget.
