SetScheduledStartTime(double)
</signature>
Changes the time at which a sound that has already been scheduled to play will start.
Notice that depending on the timing not all rescheduling requests can be fulfilled.

One interesting use case for this is stinger sound effects that are initiated by game events, but that you also want to be synchronized to specific beats in music. Then this function can be used to defer the stinger until the next musical transition.

__Note:__ In general it is better to use ::ref::PlayScheduled to cue up audio.  Only use SetScheduledStartTime if you have scheduled an audio clip to play in the future and you need to change the time at which it starts.  Calling SetScheduledStartTime will not cause an un-scheduled audio clip to play.

SA: AudioClip::ref::PlayScheduled.
@param time Time in seconds.
