</signature>
Has the transform changed since the last time the flag was set to 'false'?
A change to the transform can be anything that causes its matrix to be recalculated: any adjustment to its position, rotation or scale.
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX
	function OnUpdate () {
		if (transform.hasChanged)
		{
			print("The transform has changed!");
			transform.hasChanged = false;
		}
	}
END EX
