userAcceleration
</signature>
ユーザーが与える加速度を返す
The significance of this value is that the effect of gravity (which is also detected by the accelerometer) has been removed to leave just the acceleration from the user's movements.
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX
	var forceVec: Vector3;

	function FixedUpdate() {
		// Apply forces to an object to match the side-to-side acceleration
		// the user is giving to the device.
		rigidbody.AddForce(Input.gyro.userAcceleration.x * forceVec);
	}
END EX
