固定フレームレートで物理演算をしたときの結果に対して補完する。
By default interpolation is turned off. Commonly rigidbody interpolation is used on the player's character.
Physics is running at discrete timesteps, while graphics is renderered at variable frame rates.
This can lead to jittery looking objects, because physics and graphics are not completely in sync.
The effect is subtle but often visible on the player character, especially if a camera follows the main character.
It is recommended to turn on interpolation for the main character but disable it for everything else.
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX
	// Make the rigidbody interpolate the graphics
	rigidbody.interpolation = RigidbodyInterpolation.Interpolate;
END EX
