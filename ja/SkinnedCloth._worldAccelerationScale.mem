ワールド座標での加速がどのくらい影響をもたらすかの設定を行う
The higher this value is, the more the cloth will move as a reaction to world space acceleration of the GameObject.
If the cloth appears lifeless, try increasing this value. If it appears to get unstable when the character accelerates, try decreasing the value.

BEGIN EX
	GetComponent(SkinnedCloth).worldAccelerationScale = 1.0;
END EX
