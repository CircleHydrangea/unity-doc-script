現在のプロセッサの数を返す（読み込み専用）
This is number of processors as reported by the operating system. The processors could be separate processors,
cores of the same processor, or logical processors (e.g. in case of one Hyper-Threaded CPU, this would report
two CPUs since that's what it looks like to the system).
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX
	// Prints "4" on a quad-core CPU.

	print (SystemInfo.processorCount);
END EX
SA: SystemInfo.processorType.
