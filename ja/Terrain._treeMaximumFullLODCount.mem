treeMaximumFullLODCount
</signature>
すべてのLODでの描画される木の最大数を返す
This is an easy setting to prevent too many trees being rendered at too high resolution in dense forests.
Since there will be no fade if /treeMaximumFullLODCount/ is exceeded you should tweak the /treeBillboardDistance/ to 
not include unnecessary trees that are not being seen but, still rendered.
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX
	function Start () {
		Terrain.activeTerrain.treeMaximumFullLODCount = 200;
	}
END EX
