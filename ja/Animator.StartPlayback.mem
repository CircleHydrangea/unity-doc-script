StartPlayback()
</signature>
Sets the animator in playback mode.
In this mode, the animator is not updated from game logic and is controlled instead by setting time value. Note that time will not automatically progress here, you have to manipulate it explicitly from ::ref::playbackTime.
PlaybackRecordedFrame should be used to playback recorded data.
